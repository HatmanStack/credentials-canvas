## What is Credentials Canvas?

**Credentials Canvas** is an immersive 3D portfolio experience that showcases personal projects in an interactive virtual environment. Instead of a traditional portfolio website, visitors explore a fully realized 3D scene where each element tells a story and provides access to different projects and achievements.

### üéÆ Interactive Experience
- **Navigate** through a detailed 3D environment with smooth camera controls
- **Click** on various objects to discover projects, skills, and accomplishments  
- **Explore** different themed "vibes" that transform the lighting and atmosphere
- **Engage** with interactive elements like control panels, phones, and signposts

### üèóÔ∏è 3D Environment Features
- **Dynamic Lighting System** - Interactive lights that respond to user clicks
- **Video Displays** - Phone screens showing project demos and presentations
- **Atmospheric Controls** - Multiple environment themes (Urban, Rural, Classy, Chill)
- **Particle Effects** - Visual enhancements that bring the scene to life
- **Sound Design** - Audio feedback for interactions and ambiance

### üì± Project Showcase
The 3D environment serves as a unique portfolio platform featuring:
- **Web Applications** - Interactive demos accessible through in-scene displays
- **Technical Projects** - Links to GitHub repositories and live deployments
- **Professional Links** - Direct access to LinkedIn, articles, and contact information
- **Skills Demonstration** - 3D modeling, web development, and interactive design capabilities

### üé® Creative Approach
Rather than listing projects in a traditional format, Credentials Canvas presents them as part of a cohesive 3D narrative where:
- Each interactive element has purpose and meaning
- Projects are contextualized within a virtual space
- The portfolio itself demonstrates technical and artistic skills
- Visitors have a memorable, engaging experience

## Tech Stack
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- Node.js backend

## Setup
1. Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hatmanstack/credentials-camvas.git
cd credentials-camvas
npm install --global yarn
yarn
npm start
```

2. Download the custom model:
- Get `.glb` file from [here](https://production.dld9ll6ojjns2.amplifyapp.com/compressed_model.glb)
- Place in public folder

## Model Optimization (if altering in Blender):
```bash
gltf-pipeline -i updated.glb -o compressed_model.glb --draco.compressionLevel=7 --keepUnusedElements --keepDefaultScene
```
